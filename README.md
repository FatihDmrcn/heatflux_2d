# 2D Heatflux Simulation


![gui](misc/gui.PNG "Screenshot of the GUI")


This small application was coded initially as part of a student project.
It is a Lattice gas automaton with a hexagonal grid (model introduced by Uriel **F**risch, Brosl **H**asslacher and Yves **P**omeau in 1986),
simulating a flow around a NACA-Profile in a tunnel. Further enhancements are going to be done soon!
